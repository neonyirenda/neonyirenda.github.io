What exactly would I really be out here promising.

<!--more-->

I honestly have so much I want to type up but I'm doing  more than anything and barely have Ruby/Jekyll setup, most likely because I nuked the OS install I had on my daily driver and weren't bothered enough to setup the things I don't day daily. 

THAT CHANGES NNOW. I'll have it setup so I can upload more often and probably work twards doing this more. I'm looing to move this whole thing into Flask which means I'll probably need to change hosts which is fine OR if someone knows if I can use github still (pressing X for doubt). 

I should also brush up on my markdown because outside `from life import code` and [links](https://github.com/neonyirenda) I'm not well versed in the various edits I can make. Wait I just remembered from my git uploads (mostly private repos) I do use hashtags as well.
