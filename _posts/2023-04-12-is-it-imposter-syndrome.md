In my experience, I've found that having big, ambitious ideas is crucial to achieving meaningful results.

However, I do have a tendency to get lost in my thoughts and procrastinate. Sometimes, I even complicate things unnecessarily.

Despite these challenges, I have achieved many things in the past and find great joy in doing so. So, I don't think I purposely get in my own way.

Recently, I've been wondering if I'm capable of the tasks I've set before me or if I've taken on too much. Sometimes, I get hung up on minor design aspects of a project, and I'm not sure if it's warranted or just me overthinking things.

While these thoughts may seem like the ramblings of a mad mind, they're a natural part of my thought process as I work towards my goals. If you're on mobile this site is another one of the few headaches I took upon myself just so I can actively work on these machinations of mine rather than toy with ideas in a playground I made for it of sorts. My realisation since has been, I know flexbox but do I know flex box?
