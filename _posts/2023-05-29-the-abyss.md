I've spent several months trying things the way people wanted me too and I can't help but feel, it's not necessarily the right way.

This post is to basically state this is still very much alive, just been busy with a lot of everything else that didn't leave space for having my mind think in a different language. Easy as Jekyll may be it's a completely new and different structure than I"m otherwise used to. I'll try to post more often than usual and hope I can at least document my time here as I inch closer to the future I'm searching for.

ps. It honestly took me this long to realise there was something wrong with the author page. 🤦🏿‍♂️
