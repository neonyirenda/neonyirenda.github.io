Fancy effect on the homepage, yeah? Well let me tell you, it isn't a fancy implementation.

<!--more-->

It all started when I saw The Fedora Project was working on a new [site](https://fedoraproject.org) and saw their landing page had a bunch of things being typed out and backspaced then eventually a final word appears.

Anyways I saw it and thought let me see if I can replicate that, granted they had an error (or maybe it was intended) in their implementation I was going to do it the way I expected it to act.

If you haven't noticed by now, this is mostly a place where I'll be attempting different things, coding snipets and what have you just to keep myself busy and hopefully learn something new and getting dirty with code. I will maybe say something random ([like my list of tv shows](https://neonyirenda.github.io/2023/04/13/case-of-the-next.html)) if I'm in a mood to chill tf out because something certainly had me working too hard.

I currently only have one js script associated with this Github page so if you fancy to re-implement it go ahead, just don't claim it's yours 😀. *Plus I Don’t Have Time To Explain What I Don’t Have Time To Understand*😮‍💨. I do but just go through the source code on my [github](https://github.com/neonyirenda/neonyirenda.github.io).

I'd usually say something Trekky here, so I'll pretend I did, and keep your eyes to the sky guardians 😁

_With regards to the Fedora Project link they might have finally been launched when you read this so head on over to their main page [here](https://getfedora.org)_
