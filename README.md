## Gripes

- All that fooling around with github and just deleting my initial test repo and reuploading afresh fixed it?

- Started working on a mobile centric page but thus far I'm only happy about it's desktop appearance.

- I'll look into optimising it for mobile divices soon but I just wanted to get what I had working on my computer to reflect github.
